# Introduction
This implementation plan outlines the steps required to realize the multi-agent microservices architecture as specified in the corresponding architecture specification. It breaks down the work into features, user stories, and actionable tasks, with time estimates and milestones for delivery.

## 1. Purpose & Scope
The purpose of this plan is to guide the setup and initial development of a scalable, containerized multi-agent system, including agents, supporting services, and the necessary infrastructure. The scope covers project structure, technology stack setup, API contracts, containerization, orchestration, and CI/CD integration.


## 2. Features, User Stories and Tasks

- **Feature 1**: Project Structure & Repository Setup (3h)
  - **User Stories**:
    - As a developer, I want a clear project structure so that I can easily add new agents and services. (3h)
      - **Tasks**:
        - Create base directory structure for agents, services, shared, infra, docs, tests, scripts
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Directory structure matches specification and is committed to version control. (2h)
        - Add README and contribution guidelines
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Documentation is clear and accessible. (1h)

- **Feature 2**: Technology Stack Initialization (6h)
  - **User Stories**:
    - As a developer, I want the recommended backend frameworks and database technologies initialized so that I can start service development quickly. (6h)
      - **Tasks**:
        - Initialize Python/FastAPI, Node.js/Express, and Go/Gin service templates
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Each template builds and runs in a container. (4h)
        - Set up PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis containers for development
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Databases are accessible from service containers. (2h)

- **Feature 3**: API Contract & Documentation (5h)
  - **User Stories**:
    - As a developer, I want API contracts defined and documented so that services can communicate reliably. (5h)
      - **Tasks**:
        - Define OpenAPI/Swagger specs for agent and service APIs
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: API specs are published and versioned. (3h)
        - Set up API documentation site (e.g., Swagger UI)
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: API docs are accessible and up-to-date. (2h)

- **Feature 4**: Containerization & Orchestration (9h)
  - **User Stories**:
    - As a DevOps engineer, I want all services containerized and orchestrated so that deployment is automated and scalable. (9h)
      - **Tasks**:

        - Write Dockerfiles for all service templates
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Services build and run in containers.
          - **Time Estimate**: 3h
        - Create Kubernetes manifests for deployment
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Services deploy and communicate in a local cluster.
          - **Time Estimate**: 4h
        - Set up service discovery (Kubernetes DNS/Consul)
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Services are discoverable and reachable.
          - **Time Estimate**: 2h

- **Feature 5**: CI/CD Pipeline & Test Automation
  - **Time Estimate**: 9h
  - **User Stories**:
    - As a developer, I want automated testing and deployment pipelines so that code quality and delivery are consistent.
      - **Time Estimate**: 9h
      - **Tasks**:
        - Configure GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Pipelines run on PRs and merges.
          - **Time Estimate**: 3h
        - Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Tests run automatically and meet coverage requirements.
          - **Time Estimate**: 4h
        - Set up performance/load testing (Locust/k6)
          - **Acceptance Criteria**: Performance tests are automated and results are tracked.
          - **Time Estimate**: 2h



## 3. Milestones

# Milestone deadlines are calculated by summing the time estimates for all included work, then adding a 25% buffer for coordination, review, and unexpected issues. Each milestone is mapped to realistic workdays (assuming 6h/day per developer) and adjusted for weekends.

- **Milestone 1**: Project Foundation
  - **Deadline**: 2025-07-30
  - **Deliverables**: Directory structure, README, contribution guidelines
  - **Features**: Project Structure & Repository Setup (3h)
  - **Calculation**: 3h + 0.75h buffer = 3.75h ≈ 1 workday

- **Milestone 2**: Technology Stack & Service Templates
  - **Deadline**: 2025-08-01
  - **Deliverables**: Service templates, database containers
  - **Features**: Technology Stack Initialization (6h)
  - **Calculation**: 6h + 1.5h buffer = 7.5h ≈ 2 workdays

- **Milestone 3**: API Contracts & Documentation
  - **Deadline**: 2025-08-05
  - **Deliverables**: API specs, documentation site
  - **Features**: API Contract & Documentation (5h)
  - **Calculation**: 5h + 1.25h buffer = 6.25h ≈ 2 workdays

- **Milestone 4**: Containerization & Orchestration
  - **Deadline**: 2025-08-11
  - **Deliverables**: Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, service discovery
  - **Features**: Containerization & Orchestration (9h)
  - **Calculation**: 9h + 2.25h buffer = 11.25h ≈ 2 workdays

- **Milestone 5**: CI/CD & Test Automation
  - **Deadline**: 2025-08-15
  - **Deliverables**: CI/CD pipelines, automated tests, performance testing
  - **Features**: CI/CD Pipeline & Test Automation (9h)
  - **Calculation**: 9h + 2.25h buffer = 11.25h ≈ 2 workdays
