# Introduction
This specification defines the foundational architecture for a multi-agent system based on microservices, with agents and supporting services hosted in containers. It establishes the structural, technical, and operational requirements to support future functional development.

## 1. Purpose & Scope
The purpose of this specification is to provide a clear, scalable, and maintainable structure for a multi-agent system where:
- Agents are independent microservices.
- Communication occurs via APIs.
- Some microservices serve as supporting services (not agents).
Scope includes project structure, technology stack, communication patterns, and deployment considerations.

## 2. Definitions
- **Agent**: An autonomous microservice responsible for specific tasks or decision-making.
- **Microservice**: A small, independently deployable service with a well-defined API.
- **API**: Application Programming Interface, used for inter-service communication.
- **Container**: A lightweight, portable unit for running microservices (e.g., Docker).
- **Orchestration**: Automated management of containers (e.g., Kubernetes).
- **Service Mesh**: Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication.

## 3. Requirements, Constraints, and Recommendations

### 1. Requirements
- **REQ-001**: Each agent must be implemented as an independent microservice.
  - Ensures modularity and independent deployment.
- **REQ-002**: All inter-agent and service communication must occur via APIs (REST/gRPC).
  - Promotes loose coupling and scalability.
- **REQ-003**: Supporting services must be implemented as microservices and exposed via APIs.
  - Enables orchestration and shared functionality.
- **REQ-004**: All microservices must be containerized for deployment.
  - Facilitates portability and environment consistency.

### 2. Constraints
- **CON-001**: Agents and services must not share state directly; use APIs or message queues.
  - Prevents tight coupling and data inconsistency.
- **CON-002**: All services must be stateless or manage state externally (e.g., databases).
  - Supports scalability and resilience.
- **SEC-001**: All API communication must be authenticated and encrypted.
  - Ensures security and compliance.

### 3. Recommendations
- **REC-001**: Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API contract definition.
  - Improves clarity and interoperability.
- **REC-002**: Employ a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for observability and traffic management.
  - Enhances reliability and monitoring.
- **PAT-001**: Adopt Domain-Driven Design for service boundaries.
  - Promotes maintainability and clear ownership.

## 4. Technology Stack

### 1. Frontend
- Not defined at this stage; future specifications will address UI requirements.

### 2. Backend
- **Languages**: Python, Node.js, Go (recommended for microservices)
  - Chosen for ecosystem maturity and container compatibility.
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI (Python), Express (Node.js), Gin (Go)
  - Supports rapid API development and scalability.

### 3. Database
- **PostgreSQL**: For relational data and transactional integrity.
- **MongoDB**: For flexible, document-based storage.
- **Redis**: For caching and message brokering.

## 5. Interface & Data Contracts
- All APIs must be documented using OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Input/output formats: JSON (default), with support for gRPC where performance is critical.
- API endpoints must be versioned and follow RESTful conventions.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- **AC-001**: Given an agent microservice, when it is deployed in a container, then it must expose its API and operate independently.
- **AC-002**: The system shall allow agents and services to communicate only via authenticated APIs.
- **AC-003**: Supporting services must be discoverable and accessible by agents via API endpoints.

## 7. Test Automation Strategy
- **Test Levels**: Unit, Integration, End-to-End
- **Frameworks**: Pytest (Python), Jest (Node.js), Go test (Go)
- **Test Data Management**: Use containerized databases for test isolation.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions pipelines.
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage for all services.
- **Performance Testing**: Use Locust or k6 for load testing APIs.

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems
- **EXT-001**: Service discovery (e.g., Consul, Kubernetes DNS) - for dynamic endpoint resolution.

### Third-Party Services
- **SVC-001**: API Gateway (e.g., Kong, NGINX) - for routing and security.

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **INF-001**: Container orchestration platform (Kubernetes) - for deployment and scaling.

### Data Dependencies
- **DAT-001**: Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) - for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Technology Platform Dependencies
- **PLT-001**: Docker runtime - for containerization.

### Compliance Dependencies
- **COM-001**: GDPR compliance for data handling - impacts API design and data storage.

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

```python
# Example: Agent API endpoint definition (FastAPI)
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/status")
def status():
    return {"status": "active"}

# Edge Case: Agent fails to start; container health check returns 503
```

## 10. Validation Criteria
- All agents and services must pass health checks and expose documented APIs.
- API endpoints must be authenticated and encrypted.
- Automated tests must cover all API endpoints and edge cases.
